#This Code  loads ingredients for Eyelink integration to Psychopy. Steps are called together in el_setup at the top of the experiment code. 

#STEP 1: Ingredients neccessary
#pylink is the eyelink package for psychopy
from pylink import *
#pygame is explicitly used to take screenshots and write them to data viewer
from pygame import *
import time
import gc #unclear whether we need this for this specific experiment but leaving in just in case
import sys
import os
#This is the eyelink core graphics library and contains the calibration rolutine
from EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy import EyeLinkCoreGraphicsPsychoPy


#Here we will set up some variables that will help us out later.
#This guy is helpful for setting up function loops, so the experiment can run with or without eye tracking
eyetracking=True
#these are set up for getting gaze position data in a loop that checks for eye data samples later
RIGHT_EYE = 1
LEFT_EYE = 0
BINOCULAR = 2
#these are used in setting up display coordinates and calculating screen size for a variety of functions
screen_width=win.size[0]
screen_height=win.size[1]

#STEP 2: Intiialize connection to tracker
el = EyeLink('100.1.1.1')
